# What is a programming language?

***Programming languages allow us to translate the 1s and 0s of binary into code we can understand.***

**Computers** take an input and return an output.

**Binary** is a common programming language of 1s and 0s that all computers understand.

## Low-Level vs High-Level languages

**Low-level** languages are closer to binary (how the computer "thinks").
-Difficult to read and write
-Fast
-Precise control

**High-level** languages are closer to how humans communicate.
